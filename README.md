# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course.
It is a simple recipe website built using only HTML.

The goal of this project was to practice basic HTML structure
and elements.

## Skills Demonstrated
- HTML boilerplate
- Headings and paragraphs
- Links and images
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- File organization

## Reflection
This project helped me gain confidence using HTML and building
a basic multi-page website from scratch.
